# Brokerage Calculator Mini-Project

This is a mini-project that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java to build a brokerage calculator. 
The project focuses on key OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and method overloading.

## Features

- **Abstraction**: An abstract class `BrokerageCalculator` defines the common structure for brokerage calculations.
- **Inheritance**: The project includes `EquityBrokerageCalculator` and `CommodityBrokerageCalculator` classes, which inherit from `BrokerageCalculator`.
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields are used to store data, and public getter methods are provided for access.
- **Method Overriding**: Subclasses override the `calculateBrokerage()` method to provide specific implementations for different types of assets.
- **Method Overloading**: The `calculateBrokerage()` method is overloaded to allow calculations with or without taxes.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── com/example/brokeragecalculator/
│   ├── BrokerageCalculator.java       # Abstract class with common properties and methods
│   ├── EquityBrokerageCalculator.java # Calculates brokerage for equity transactions
│   ├── CommodityBrokerageCalculator.java # Calculates brokerage for commodity transactions
│   └── Main.java                      # Main class to run and demonstrate the project
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darshanhandi/BrokerageCalculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd brokerage-calculator
   ```

3. **Compile and run the project**:
   You can compile the project using a Java compiler or run it directly in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

   To compile using the command line:
   ```bash
   javac src/com/example/brokeragecalculator/*.java
   ```

   To run the program:
   ```bash
   java com.example.brokeragecalculator.Main
   ```

4. **Example output**:
   ```
   Equity Brokerage without taxes: 11.0
   Equity Brokerage with taxes: 13.01
   Commodity Brokerage without taxes: 5.5
   Commodity Brokerage with taxes: 7.51
   ```
